# Introduction

## Purpose

The main purpose of this document is to share relevant information and outline the process that KEIFCA have thus far followed to develop management for Goodwin Sands Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ). 

The document provides information about the geography of the site and the jurisdiction boundaries, the designated features and their conservation objectives, key stakeholders, additional data, the process for selecting areas for management, with the aim to guide the key next steps required to develop management for the Goodwin Sands MCZ.

## Key next steps
A key issue that KEIFCA needs to determine (and the aim for a scoping meeting scheduled for the 8^th^ March 2021) is to determine the management envelopes (boundaries) for the work to be undertaken in partnership with the MMO and NE with respect developing management for Goodwin Sands MCZ. The roles of the MMO and KEIFCA needs to be determined with respect to the Fisheries Assessment (Assessment) and Fisheries Management (Management) wich is to be prepared for the whole site or two separate components for the inshore and offshore within the respective jurisdictions of KEIFCA and the MMO.

Previously, the Assessment and Management for Margate and Long Sands SAC, similar to Goodwin Sands MCZ, spans across the 6 NM boundary into inshore and offshore areas, was prepared considering the site as a single entity. KEIFCA proposes that a similar approach is taken to developing Management for the Goodwin Sands MCZ, working closely with the MMO and NE.

If this is agreed, the key issue then is who leads on the various components, and how could the workload and roles be divided. This will be the key topic to discuss in March 2021 in a meeting between the Government bodies (NE, MMO and KEIFCA).

## Approach
### Process up to date
KEIFCA has started the process of developing Management for the Goodwin Sands MCZ. So far, KEIFCA has collated and assessed information about the site, engaged with stakeholders, and carried out some preliminary spatial planning exercises to facilitate further conversations regarding the development of Management for the site (used to refer to Goodwin Sands MCZ hereafter).

#### Data assessment
The assessment up to date has considered the MCZ boundaries, KEIFCA and MMO boundaries, the conservation features and their conservation objectives, as well as the inshore fishing activity in the site. KEIFCA has secured some relevant data sets regarding designated features, but also other biologically and culturally important features within the site. 

#### Engagement
Throughout this process, KEIFCA have been engaging Natural England and the MMO to make them aware that the process has been initiated, and that we are looking to engage with them. Furthermore, KEIFCA have started engaging with two key stakeholders (TFA, GSCT) to make them aware that management planning for the site is to start this year, and that it is likely to consider measures that will restrict the use of bottom towed gear in the site. (This is stated upfront to be as transparent about the likely outcome from the Assessment as possible from the outset of developing the Management). KEIFCA has engaged the CEFAS, MMO, DEFRA, JNCC, ZSL, RSPB, and Sandwich Bay Bird Observatory as part of its data collation efforts. 

#### Spatial planning
KEIFCA developed a spatial planning model that implements a well established scientifically rigorous process (systematic conservation planning) to objectively guide spatial management decisions. The model identifies the minimum area required to meet quantitative conservation targets, while minimising the socio-economic impact (on fisheres). The model allows for a quantitative assessment of how well the conservation targets the associated socio-economic cost incurred by closing areas to an activity. The model provides the opportunity to develop multiple scenarios which can be compared, and the input data sets and functional objectives and can be updated with new information, or a refinement of model parameters and additional stakeholder input. Ultimately, as used here, it serves as guidance of where to exclude bottom towed fishing gear in an objective and transparent manner which can be shared with stakedholers. As the process is objective and transparent it allows stakeholders to interrogate outputs and understand and feed into the driving forces behind areas being earmarked for closure. The final earmarked areas that the model puts forward will then serve as a guide on which to base practical simplified boundaries. Such a simplification may be to enclose the earmarked areas in rectangular boxes, allowing navigation, fishing and enforcement, to work with the new management.

```

#### Future plans
Following agreement of organisational roles and the scope of the work, a Fisheries Assessment will be initiated for Goodwin Sands MCZ. The management will be developed concurrently. 

A key part of the process is to iteratively review the outputs produced by the model, and will be carried out iteratively and presented and discussed with stakeholders. Dates and appropriate stakeholders will be identified and notified of meetings to discuss management planning.

KEIFCA has also applied for research funding with NE to survey Sabellaria reefs in the Goodwin Sands MCZ, which aims to feedback and improve the management of the site.

KEIFCA have also engaged with Goodwin Sands Conversation Trust to assist in developing a community management plan for the site.

## Timeline
<!--KEIFCA has had early (pre-planning) discussions with NE, MMO and two key stakeholders since June 2020. KEIFCA  collated data sets and ran preliminary assessments (thorough a spatial optimisation process) to identify potential spatial solutions that could be used to guide where to put management within the MCZ. The purpose of preliminary assessments were to identify a data requirements, process, and pitfalls to help inform discussions about co-management with the MMO, NE and stakeholders. -->

This document now describes the planning process in more detail.

## Background: Government bodies
KEIFCA is the responsible local authority for fisheries management of MCZs in inshore areas within the Kent and Essex district, while the MMO manages fisheries activities in English waters from 6 NM to the offshore boundary of English territorial waters. The Goodwin Sands is a large MCZ (277 km^2^) which straddles the inshore boundary of KEIFCA's district (0 - 6 NM) thereby falling partly within the KEIFCA district and partly in the MMO's jurisdiction. Natural England is responsible for providing conservation advice for all Marine Protected Areas within England's inshore waters to support sites to achieve their conservation objectives and to guide effective management. These three Government bodies are therefore required to work closely together in developing management for Goodwin Sands MCZ.

## Background: Conservation features and objectives 
The Goodwin Sands MCZ was designated 31^st^ May 2019 to protect the following six features and there respective conservation objectives are stated: 

1. Ross worm reefs (*Sabellaria spinulosa*): **Recover** to favourable condition
2. Blue mussel beds (*Mytilus edulis*): **Recover** to favourable condition
3. Moderate energy circalittoral rock: **Recover** to favourable condition
4. Subtidal coarse sediment: Maintain in favourable condition
5. Subtidal sand: Maintain in favourable condition
6. English Channel outburst flood features:Maintain in favourable condition

## Features with recover objectives

Ross worm reefs, blue mussel beds and circalittoral rock have objectives to recover to a favourable conservation status. These features are known to be sensitive to fishing activities which interact with the seabed (<https://www.marlin.ac.uk/data-extract>), such as bottom towed gears, and hence the requirement of management measures for the site.

Ross worm reefs are of particular conservation interest, given the enhanced biodiversity associated with the three dimensional structure provided reef. 

### Ross worm reefs
Ross worm shows medium to high levels of sensitivity to pressures associated with bottom towed fishing gear, such as:

1. Removal of non-target species
2. Physical change (to another seabed type)
3. Physical change (to another sediment type)
4. Abrasion/disturbance of the substrate on the surface of the seabed
5. Penetration and/or disturbance of the substrate below the surface of the seabed, including abrasion
6. Smothering and siltation rate changes (Heavy)
*(to be fully assessed in the Fisheries Assessment for the site).*

## Fishing activity in the site
There is limited fishing activity in the Goodwin Sands MCZ. In 2019 (at the time of designation)  the cost estimates for the site were approximately £4k per year relating to the ports and harbours sector, £2k per year relating to the commercial fishing sector and £1k per year relating to aggregates <https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/804687/mcz-tranche3-consult-ia.pdf>.

The inshore fishing fleet's activities are primarily potting, trawling and angling, which tends to be concentrated around the peripheries of the site (KEIFCA unpublished data). The offshore is known to be used by Belgium beamers, and further investigation is required to characterise the commercial fishing sector's use of the site. Trawling activities appear primarily target the offshore boundary of the site.

```



## Management challenges

### Geographical distribution of power/jurisdictions
The Goodwin Sands MCZ falls partly within the jurisdiction of the MMO and partly KEIFCA, presenting challenges to develop management for the site. Ideally (conservation best practice), the entire Goodwin Sands MCZ is to be treated as a single entity for which a Fisheries Assessment and management is to be developed in a holistic manner.

### Geographical distribution of conservation features
While the geographical area of the zones falling into KEIFCA's (139.99 km^2^ 50.58 %) and MMO's (136.76^2^ km: 49.42 %) jurisdictions are roughly similar in size, the designated features are not evenly distributed across the site. For example, circalittoral rock falls almost exclusively in the offshore area (97.4 %), while the majority (75.6 %) of subtidal sand is within 6 NM limit. Furthermore the CEFAS 2014 survey suggests that  Ross worm is principally located (97.2 %) within the the MMO's jurisdiction. Spatially, it is more efficient to manage the patchwork of unevenly distributed features by considering the site as a whole because the feature overlap in their respective spatial distributions.
 
Further to this argument, several of the designated features are located close to the 6 NM boundary, and it would therefore make intuitive sense to seek transboundary management measures to have efficient spatial management measures.


### Paucity of data
The principal data set available for Ross is from the CEFAS 2014 Goodwin Sands. While this data suggested the core area to be within the north eastern side of the MCZ, it would probably be incorrect to assume that this data set is the true representation of the spatial distribution of Ross worm. Not least because the sampling probably was not sufficient for such a large site (only 90 samples were collected), and effort was skewed towards the offshore area. Consequently, KEIFCA are seeking modelled spatial distribution data for Ross worm to obtain a  better idea of potential habitat that would be suitable for Ross worm in the entire site. We have been in contact with JNCC and DEFRA to obtain existing modelled data.

The three dimensional reef structure provided by Ross worm is a key attribute associated with the enhancement of biodiversity, and also the designated feature, as opposed to the presence of the species itself. While the species has the potential to grow rapidly, it is likely that the substantial reef structures require sufficient time to build up without major disturbance events. Consequently it is the reef structures that KEIFCA are most interested in protecting from bottom towed gears. 

KEIFCA have applied for funding a small project in which it hopes to survey and assess the reef index of known Ross worm within the Goodwin Sands MCZ. This will provide critical information to refine where management is best placed to protect Sabellaria reefs from fishing impacts.

Furthermore, Ross worm  is known to be ephemeral, with relatively high degree of spatial-temporal variation in its distribution range. While it is clear that Ross worm was present to abundant in some areas in Goodwin sands MCZ in 2014, we do not have a firm understanding of how much it change the species distribution has undergone since that time, and how it may change in future. KEIFCA has been engaging with Eastern IFCA to get a better understanding of their spatio-temporal mapping surveys used in the Wash, where they run an intensive annual monitoring programme. 



## Stakeholders
In addition to stakeholders from the three Government bodies, early engagement with primary stakeholders has been initiated to notify them of plans to develop management for Goodwin Sands MCZ. These include Thanet Fisherman's Association (TFA) and the Goodwin Sands Conservation Trust (GSCT). See Table 1 for a list of representatives for each organisation.

```{r stakeholder table, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
stakeholders <- tibble(
    Name = c("John Nichols", "Merlin Jackson", "Joanna Tomson", "Fiona Punter", "Will Wright", "Philip Haupt", "Annabel Plumeridge", "Guiletta Holly", "Christina Relf" ,"Tim Nixon", "Callum Williams"),
    Organisation = c("TFA", "TFA", "GSCT","GSCT", "KEIFCA","KEIFCA", "KEIFCA" ,"NE","NE", "MMO", "MMO")
  )
kable(stakeholders, caption = "Table 2. Stakeholders in developing management for the Goodwin Sands MCZ")
```

KEIFCA would like to invite NE and MMO to review the current list and make further suggestions to ensure appropriate stakeholder representation.

# Technical Annex

## Identifying spatial management options
This provides a description of the process that KEIFCA has thus far employed to investigate management options for the site, to agree the input data sets and the planning process used to identify spatial conservation options.

The aim of the process is to identify a suitable area/s to set aside for restricting the use of bottom towed gears. Spatial planning was underpinned using systematic conservation planning principles and through the use reserve network planning software, Gurobi, R and the PrioritizeR package.

## Planning domain
Goodwin Sands MCZ coordinates were taken directly from the designation order to create spatial boundaries in a GIS which was used and is referred to as the planning domain, site, or the MCZ, interchangeably here. the spatial distribution of all input data and processes described below are limited to the planning domain.

## Planning units
The planning domain was then divided into equal sized hexagonal planning units within which the quantity of all conservation features was calculated using standard GIS procedures. The conservation features is described further below, but to help the reader understand the immediate following section, the reader can assume that *conservation features* refers to the spatial distribution of features that we wish to protect within the area for which management is being developed.

Planning units are then selected for inclusion (or exclusion) as part of a set of planning units that collectively meet quantitative conservation targets (described below) for all the conservation features. Hereafter referred to as solution or conservation solution.

Planning units can be locked-in or -out before determining a solution. For example, some planning units may not be suitable for meeting conservation objectives. For example, in the preliminary spatial planning, the area licensed for aggregate dredging in the site was locked-out, as it would be controversial to ban bottom towed fishing gear when intensive aggregate dredging is allowed. 

Furthermore, a socio-economic cost can be associated with each planning unit, to preferentially attempt to select planning units that can meet conservation targets but do not carry a high socio-economic cost.

The selection of planning units to create a *conservation solution* is also described further below, but in principal it refers to a mathematical algorithm that identifies the planning units which are best to include in a solution to meet the conservation targets.

## Conservation targets
Conservation targets are quantitative targets, usually specified as the proportion of the overall amount (may be area or abundance) of a conservation feature in the planning domain. Hereafter referred to as targets of conservation targets interchangeably.

```{r cons_targets_table, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="centre"}
library(tidyverse)
conservation_targets <- tibble(
  ID = c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
  `Feature names` = c("Ross worm reefs", "Mussel beds", "Subtidal sand", "Subtidal mixed sediment", "Subtidal coarse sediment", "Moderate energy circalittoral rock"),
  Target = c(2.5, 2, 20, 0, 20, 3.5)
  )
kable(conservation_targets, caption = "Table 3. Conservation targets for designated features (and one additional feature) used in developing management for the Goodwin Sands MCZ.")

```

## Conservation Features
The  input data is then further divided into 1) designated feature data, 2) additional features data. 

A (spatial) solution will then calculated to meet the targets for the two types of conservation features, however, it will use assign a priority to meeting the targets for designated features over additional features to ensure meeting all targets for designated features as far as possible.

### Designated features
The table below specifies the conservation features and their data sources. English Channel outburst features were not included as this geological features is larger than eh site itself.

### Additional feature data
Additional data sets are currently being explored, but are not mandatory to include in developing management for meeting the site objectives. We would like to include available data, as described, to maximise conservation benefits, while not detracting from the primary objectives - to afford protection to the designated features.

```{r add_data_sources, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
add_data_sets <- tibble(`Data set ID` =
  seq(1:5),
  `Data set name` = c(
    "Subtidal mixed sediments",
    "Essential Fish Habitat",
    "Bird survey data",
    "Seal haul outs",
    "Ship wrecks"
  ),
  Source = c(
    "NE Habitat maps",
    "Zoological Society of London (ZSL)",
    "CEFAS and MMO",
    "Sandwich Bird Observatory, RSPB",
    "UKHO, GSCT"
  ))

kable(add_data_sets, caption = "Table 5. Additional data sets for non-designated features used in developing management for the Goodwin Sands MCZ")
```

### Socio-economic cost
A socio-economic cost can be associated with planning units to further inform the process of selecting planning units for inclusion and exclusion as part of a solution. It works on the principal of assigning a cost to each planning unit, which penalises the algorithm when selecting a planning unit for inclusion in the earmarked area. The algorithm (which tries to achieve the conservation targets in as few as possible planning units) will therefore avoid selecting planning units with a high cost if the target can be met in other planning units. The location of trawling may be very suitable as a socio-economic cost becuase this activity will be impacted by the management measures introduced in the earmarked area. Alternatively, a uniform cost can be assigned to the planning units across the planning domain.

### Conservation solutions through optimisation
We developed a script (computer code) in R statistical software which uses functions provided in an R package (PrioritizeR) to interface with integer linear programming (Gurobi). The model then uses the algorithm to earmark planning units for inclusion in a area covered by the byelaw to solve a spatial conservation problem. The spatial conservation problem was specified as attempting to meet the conservation targets while minimising the socio-economic costs incurred while doing so. Furthermore the objective function of the model was set to calculate the minimum set of planning units to achieve these targets. Other options exist for to specify the objective function, such as maximum target achievement. The conservation problem was therefore parameterised in terms of the planning domain, planning units, conservation features data, conservation targets and constraints, such as socio-economic costs. The model operates within this set of constraints, and will find the optimal solution based on the specified parameters. Adjusting any of these parameters could result in a change in the output, which provides flexibility to test different scenarios.
